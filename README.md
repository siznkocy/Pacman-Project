# Pacman-Project
This is my first C++ project. This project is a pacman game similar to the original game.The how to "play" instructions are displayed on the game window(right side of the screen and score once you eat the corns). 

To develop I used. 
   - C++ language.
   - Sfml libary.
   - visual studio code.
   - and Youtube üòÅ.
The game control pacman scritly used up, down, left and right keys from your keyboard. 

NB: However the are bugs with regards to the game the player (pacman) and game ghots doesn't collide with the prink walls.  
    unlike the conversional game the ghots are blind to the player (They can't track the player they just move arbitrary).
    Laslty they are no levels, THIS game is just a basic game.
